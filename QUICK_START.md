# Quick Start Guide - FPL Stats Hub

## üöÄ Getting Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Open the Website

**Option A: Direct File (Simplest)**
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser:
- Double-click `index.html`, or
- Right-click ‚Üí Open with ‚Üí Your browser
- The site will use hash-based URLs like `file:///.../index.html#/live-table`

For a better experience that matches deployment:
1. Double-click `serve.bat` (Windows), or
2. Run `python serve.py` in terminal
3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
4. The site will use clean URLs like `http://localhost:8000/live-table`

### 2. Enter Your League ID

2. Click on "Leagues" and select your league
3. Look at the URL: `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/314/standings/c`
